<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Windows Sockets, or
&quot;WinSock&quot; as it has become known, is an open network
API standard. It was first designed to create a standard
programming interface for TCP/IP on all versions of Microsoft
Windows including Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT
and Windows 95. The major benefits of WinSock to date have come
in 3 areas. First, by providing an open API standard rather than
a closed proprietary API, it has helped foster the success of
TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Second,
application developers have been able to easily create
applications that will run on many different vendors' TCP/IP
network stacks. Third, it has made it much easier for end users
and MIS managers to select both applications and network stacks -
they need only look for WinSock compatibility.</font></p>
