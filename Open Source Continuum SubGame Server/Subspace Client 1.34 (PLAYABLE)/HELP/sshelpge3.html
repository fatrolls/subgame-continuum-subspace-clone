notice green dots appear from time to time. When you pick these

up.&quot; Powerups can be positive (or in rare cases, negative)
and are listed below:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><em>POSITIVE</em><br>
<img src="images/guns.gif" width="78" height="24"> UPGRADE GUNS -
There are three levels of guns in the game. Each one
progressively does more damage and costs more energy to fire. You
fire your bullets by pressing CTRL.<br>
<img src="images/gunsb.gif" width="78" height="24"> BOUNCING
BULLETS - This powerup makes your neutron pellets bounce off
walls.<br>
<img src="images/gunsm.gif" width="78" height="24"> MULTIFIRE -
This powerup makes your guns fire a spread of three bullets ahead
of you. It is toggled ON/OFF with the DEL key.<br>
<img src="images/gunss.gif" width="78" height="24"> SINGLEFIRE
(with Multifire turned off)<br>
<img src="images/gunsbm.gif" width="78" height="24"> MULTIFIRE
and BOUNCING BULLETS<br>
<img src="images/gunsbs.gif" width="78" height="24"> SINGLEFIRE
(with Multifire turned off) and BOUNCING BULLETS<br>
<img src="images/bombs.gif" width="78" height="24"> UPGRADE BOMBS
- Bombs do area damage (which can be outside the visible area of
explosion!) There are 3 levels of bombs and they progressively do
more damage and cost more energy to fire.<br>
**Note: The Weasel uses an EMP bomb<br>
<img src="images/bombsp.gif" width="78" height="24"> PROXIMITY -
Bombs explode within range of enemy (range increases with bomb
level).<br>
<img src="images/bombss.gif" width="78" height="24"> SHRAPNEL -
Bombs expel shrapnel equivalent to gun level bullets.<br>
<img src="images/bombsps.gif" width="78" height="24"> PROXIMITY

UPGRADE SPEED - Increases the top speed of your ship (limited to
maximum).<br>
UPGRADE THRUST - Increases how fast you can accelerate (limited
to maximum).<br>
UPGRADE ROTATION - Increases how fast your ship can turn (limited
to maximum).<br>
<img src="images/stealth.gif" width="52" height="24">STEALTH -
When you activate stealth your are invisible on the RADAR map
display to all other players. Stealth is a large drain on your
ships batteries so you should use with discretion.<br>
<img src="images/cloak.gif" width="52" height="24">CLOAK - When
you activate the cloaking device your ship becomes INVISIBLE
however your radar image can still be seen. Cloak is an enormous
drain on your energy reserves and turns off when you fire.<br>
<b>Note:</b> A ship that is stealthed AND cloaked is completely
invisible on RADAR and VISIBLE light to other ships that do not
have XRADAR turned on.<br>
<img src="images/xradar.gif" width="52" height="24">XRADAR - Ahh
but there is always a catch :) The XRADAR reveals all STEALTHed
and CLOAKed ships on the map when activated.<br>
<img src="images/anitwarp.gif" width="52" height="24">ANTIWARP -
When activated, prevents ships within range from WARPing to
safety when activated.<br>
FULL CHARGE - Automatically charges your ship to its maximum
battery capacity.<br>
WARP - Warps you across the map.<br>

src="images/minesemp.gif" width="32" height="31">EMP MINES-
Stationary bombs (of your current bomb level) that you place on
the playing field (PROXIMITY and SHRAPNEL work just like do with
bombs)<br>
<img src="images/burst.gif" width="26" height="24">BURST - This
little baby throws out level 4 bullets in all directions from
your ship. HOWEVER. These bullets are only active AFTER they have
bounced off something (will not bounce off enemy ships).<br>
<img src="images/repel.gif" width="26" height="24">REPEL - Throws
away from your ship all enemy ships/bombs/mines &amp; bullets. A
one shot weapon.<br>
<img src="images/decoy.gif" width="26" height="24">DECOY - When
activated, the decoy will take on all of your ship&#146;s
characteristics including velocity, direction, flag count and
looks (including Nightwasp). The decoy will not have thrust and
bullets and bombs will pass through it. Decoys also show up on
radar and cannot be counteracted by XRADAR.<br>
<img src="images/thorsham.gif" width="26" height="24">THOR&#146;S
HAMMER - Level4 Pbomb that travels through walls. A one shot
weapon.<br>
<img src="images/brick.gif" width="26" height="24">BRICK - Drops
a 7 by 1 wall that drops perpendicular to the nearest wall.<br>
<img src="images/rocket.gif" width="26" height="24">ROCKET -

and bombs without any energy drain.<br>
SHIELDS(see <i>Status Panel</i> below) - Counts down from 100%
and indicates percentage of protection from damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><em>NEGATIVE<br>
</em>Sometimes when you pick up a powerup it will REMOVE an item
from your ship. For every bonus listed up above there is an
OPPOSITE effect that can take away your preciously built up
bonuses. In addition there are very special unpleasant Negatives
that you can pick up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">ENGINE SHUTDOWN! This Negative
disables your thrusters for a few seconds and you will only be
able to rotate slowly.<br>
ENGINE SHUTDOWN SEVERE! - The worst thing that can happen. As
above but you are held for 40+ seconds.<br>
ENERGY DEPLETED This Negative takes away your energy. (Very bad
if you are in battle or a congested area!)</font></p>

you got killed.<br>

stopped. This number decreases as time goes on.<br>
<b>Super</b>. This number represents how many seconds you have
left until firing weapons uses energy again.<br>
<b>Portal Timer</b>. This number represents how many seconds you
have left until your portal dissappears.<br>
<b>Flag drop Timer</b>. This number represents how many seconds
you have left until your Flags become stationary objects that
must be defended from enemy team members. <br>
<b>King of the Hill Timer</b>. This number represents how many
seconds you have left to live to be declared 'KING'.</font></p>
