<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Once at the enemy, you should not
aspire just to strike him, but to cling after the attack.&quot;<br>
-Myamoto Mushashi</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;You can have computer sights or
anything you like, but I think you have to go to the enemy on the
shortest distance and knock him down from point blank range.
You'll get him from close. At long distances, it&#146;s
questionable.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial">The Warbird</font>
<font face="Arial"> is the ideal craft for the
beginner. Easy to learn and packing a good punch, an expert
Warbird pilot can run rings around less maneuverable opponents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A good tactic for a Warbird pilot is to
actively seek out heavier opponents then dogfight with them
dodging opponents bullets and bombs until he believes the enemy
has depleted his energy then striking the killer blow with his
own level 2 guns. The Warbird&#146;s excellent acceleration and
turn rate makes this tactic possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Warbird pilots should be very wary about
using their gun. Although it is powerful it should not be used
for &quot;spraying&quot; a target with bullets as each round is
expensive in energy and the Warbird has little energy to spare.
The gun is best used in short bursts or even better as single
&quot;ranging&quot; shots to keep an opponent distracted until
you get nice and close then the killing burst.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When on the defensive, remember to use your
maneuver ability to cling to the edges of walls and always turn
around a wall at the very last moment. The chances are that a
clumsier craft will hit the wall and lose valuable moments
allowing you to escape.</font></p>
