<p><font face="Arial">Much has been said about &quot;Neg
Killing&quot; (A Neg is an old SubSpace slang term referring to a
time when users started out at a negative bounty to deter
powerful ships from picking on weak ships) and this section is
here to provide only one of many views on the subject.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Negs are players with weak ships and with
the current system some users feel you cannot have a proper ship
until you reach a bounty of at least 50 unless you are VERY lucky
or HIGHLY skilled. Usually you do not get enough powerups to get
decent weapons, recharge rate, energy levels, etc. Others believe
that any ship is fair game whether or not they can defend
themselves or even run away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Either way, users will develop reputations
for themselves and players will learn who they should avoid (if
they can). Since each user can set their own <i>Target Bounty</i>
to any level they wish, it all depends on the morals (for lack of
a better word) of each individual user.</font></p>
