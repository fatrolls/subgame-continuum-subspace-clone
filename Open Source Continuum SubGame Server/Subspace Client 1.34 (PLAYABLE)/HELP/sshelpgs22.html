<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="6" face="Arial"><strong>Microsoft&#146;s
DirectX</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">One of the
requirements of SubSpace is DirectX. </font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>DirectX</strong>
is a driver set that contains instructions (in files like
DDRAW.DLL and DSOUND.DLL) that makes programming games easier
within environments that support DirectX.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">Please note that
we only provide the program and any technical question on
problems installing DirectX should be referred back to Microsoft
at www.microsoft.com.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">Message from Rob
Keir</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">I was able to
duplicate some people's problems of missing DirectX DLLs and DLLs
not being able to be linked to. Here's the story...</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">&quot;SubSpace&quot;
uses two DirectX DLL files at runtime, DDRAW.DLL and DSOUND.DLL.
These are usually found in your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">If you manually
delete these DLLs, manually copy over the DLLs with other/same
versions or even just move the files somewhere else on your disk
you'll be in trouble, even if you restore the files back to their
original directory afterward. &quot;Subcheck&quot; will report
that it has found the DLLs but can't link to them and
&quot;SubSpace&quot; will say that it has a problem with
DDRAW.DLL and/or DSOUND.DLL and won't start up. This is a
peculiar problem considering that restoring the original files to
their original directory should have no effect!</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">So, here's what
you can do :-</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">If you
        haven't already done so, download the
        &quot;SubSpace&quot; game from our Web site
        (http://www.vie.com/subspace/files.htm) and install it. <strong>DON'T
        run it yet</strong>.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">If you
        haven't already done so, download the DirectX install
        program from our Web site
        (http://www.vie.com/subspace/files.htm). <strong>DON'T
        install it yet</strong>.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>REBOOT
        YOUR MACHINE</strong>. When it's finished booting
        DON&#146;T start &quot;SubSpace&quot; or any other
        program that is likely to use DirectX stuff.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">If you have
        already installed a version of the DirectX software or
        have any remnant of DirectX still on your machine then :-<br>
        <br>
        If you have them, make a backup of the
        \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DDRAW.DLL and \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DSOUND.DLL
        files, preferably to a floppy disk.<br>
        <br>
        Delete the files \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DDRAW.DLL and
        \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DSOUND.DLL.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">Run the
        DirectX.exe install file. Note that this will (very
        rudely) reboot your machine.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">&quot;SubSpace&quot;
should work now. (Probably).</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3" face="Arial">One thing to be
aware of, if you delete the files DDRAW.DLL and DSOUND.DLL and
then reboot your machine, Windows95 may fail to start. You will
then be forced to start the machine in DOS mode (select command
prompt only from the startup menu) and then copy your backup
DirectX files (see 4) back into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and
reboot. <strong>So DON'T reboot your machine directly after
deleting the files!</strong></font></p>
