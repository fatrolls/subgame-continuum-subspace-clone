<p><font face="Arial">We have been looking for a solution to this
problem for a while now. Since none of us here have an AOL (nor
any other online service) account, we haven&#146;t had the
opportunity to work on it directly. What we have found out is
that you should have the latest connection software for Windows
95. You may wish to contact Your online services support center
to see if they have dealt with this issue before (hopefully they
have).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Good Luck!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">P.S. Due to vast number of users on the AOL
network, many players have complained of high latency while
playing. Some of our users have had to switch to alternate
Internet Service Provider(s) to get a high quality connection.</font></p>

SOUNDING AOL REPLY STARTS HERE:</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">You must have America Online
(AOL) version 3.0 installed in order to play SubSpace using
Windows 95 and America Online. Prior releases of AOL do not
support a 32-bit Winsock.dll file compatible with Windows 95. If
you have Windows 3.1, you cannot play SubSpace as it does not
support DirectX (a requirement for SubSpace).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><em><strong>MORE INFORMATION</strong></em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">America Online version 3.0 is
available on http://www.aol.com or if you have a previous version
of AOL you can download America Online version 3.0 for Windows 95
by launching AOL and click the keyword &quot;GET 95&quot;.</font></p>
