Leviathan</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;With an inferior weapon system you
cannot fight a superior one. You can have a surprise success but
not success for a long time.&quot;<br>
-Lt. General Adolph Galland, Luftwaffe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Leviathan</font>
<font face="Arial"> is the only craft to
start with bombs and it has the energy capacity to use them. One
level3 bomb can destroy most starting ships and 2 can kill any
ship in the game. The Leviathan&#146;s whole strategy is centered
around bringing this weapon to bear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Leviathan players should be wary however as
bombs cost a lot of energy to use and this can leave the
Leviathan like a beached whale ready to be destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Leviathan is best suited to crowded
terrain. Remember that bombs explode when they hit walls so if
you are fighting and enemy in an enclosed space then you have an
advantage as even a near miss will cause him damage. Also bombs
can inflict damage through walls. It is always amusing to corner
an enemy hiding behind a wall then explode a bomb next to him and
watch him whine when he dies.</font></p>
