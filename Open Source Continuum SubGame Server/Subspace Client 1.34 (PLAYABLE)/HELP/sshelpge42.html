Squads</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Teams (limited to max persons on
frequency)</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When you first enter a SubSpace arena, you
are place on a frequency (or Ghz). Everyone else on that same Ghz
is on your <i>team</i>. Your team radio and weapons operate on
this frequency which means when you send a team message, only
your teammates will see it. This also means that your bullets
will not hurt teammates and teammates will not cause the
detonation of bombs or mines (**beware: bomb blasts, not the
shrapnel, from bombs exploding against walls will still hurt you
and your teammates if you are in range of the blast). You can
change you frequency in the game by typing </font><font
color="#8080FF" face="Arial"><i>=XXXX</i></font><font
color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><i> </i></font><font face="Arial">(where
XXXX is a number from 1-9999) when you have full energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Items in </font><font color="#8080FF"

are ACTUAL key presses</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Luxor and Marx are playing in the game.
Luxor send a private message to MARX (selecting Marx in the
player dialogue box using PGUP &amp; PGDN keys)<br>
</font><font color="#8080FF" face="Arial"><i>/Hi Marx wanna team
up?</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Marx then selects Luxor and send back the
private message.<br>
</font><font color="#8080FF" face="Arial"><i>/Sure, tune freq 555</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Luxor and Marx then both type the following<br>
</font><font color="#8080FF" face="Arial"><i>=555</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now on their radar screens BOTH of them
have yellow dots. Their weapons cannot hurt each other. They also
can broadcast to anyone else in on the same frequency by starting
their message with // OR '<br>
</font><font color="#8080FF" face="Arial"><i>//Hey Luxor you hear
this?<br>
'Yes Marx lets go!</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now at any time they can invite other
people to join their squadron if they wish. The // message type
will go to EVERYONE on that frequency so large squadrons are
possible. ENJOY!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Squads (unlimited membership)</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can join a squad if you get the
password from squad member or you can create your own squad a
recruit pilots to fill out your ranks. Squads differ from <i>teams</i>
in that squad members can fight against each other if they are on
different frequencies. Squad members can even be in different
sub-arenas racking up points for their squad scores. There is no
&quot;Squad Radio&quot; but you can use the </font><font
