<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Still having problems connecting?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The best way by far to connect to
the internet (through a standard modem) is to use
Microsoft&#146;s DIAL UP NETWORKING. This comes with WIN95 and
gives a true 32 bit connection. This is what it looks like...</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Double click on the icon and then
NEW CONNECTION to bring up the following screen:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Enter your providers name in the
box provided.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="images/newconnection2.gif" width="440" height="320"></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Enter the local phone number in
the area marked 'PROVIDERS PHONE NUMBER HERE'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Now double click on the new icon
created and dial up your provider. After entering your name and
password you will be logged into the internet. To play Subspace
simply run subspace and you should see player counts and be able
to log right in.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Note some providers use
proprietary dial up software such as AOL and CSERVE. Cserve has a
32 bit dialer in their INTERNET forum and you should get in touch
with them for advice on how to set it up. We have a standard AOL
&quot;fix&quot; that seems to help our users get connected.
Although we still recommend a local ISP since AOL will not
provide you the best &quot;Ping times&quot; . Clicking on the
NEXT button below will take you to the AOL page.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you still have loads of
problems and cannot get connected, email the SubSpace Team at
subspace@vie.com.</font></p>
