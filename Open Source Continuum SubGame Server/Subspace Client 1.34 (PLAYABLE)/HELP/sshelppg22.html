<p><font face="Arial">The Javelin</font>
<font face="Arial"> is a fast, well powered
craft that is hard to handle due to its relatively weak
acceleration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Speed is what the Javelin is all about. Not
only does its speed allow it to reach powerups before other ships
but it gives a decisive edge in combat if used correctly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Against other ship types, the Javelin can
use its speed to decide where and when to pick a fight. When the
Javelin pilot decides to engage he should use high speed slashing
attacks then use his speed to stand off until his fast recharge
rate allows him to strike again. Using these tactics a Javelin
can wear down and frustrate even the most powerful of opponents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Javelin&#146;s high speed also allows
it to orbit near dogfights then when one opponent is killed then
the Javelin can sweep in and finish off the loser who is
presumably damaged after the fight.</font></p>
