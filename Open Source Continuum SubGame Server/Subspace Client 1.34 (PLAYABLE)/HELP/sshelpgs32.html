<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="6" face="Arial"><strong>Start Menu</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Play Game</strong>- This
menu option puts you into the actual playing aspect of the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Set Banner</strong>- This
menu option (active only when connected to a Zone) allows you to
set a flag-type Banner that will appear next to your name in
certain Zones after accumulating a set amount of points.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Subspace comes with 15 sample
banners (sample00.bmp, sample01.bmp, sample02.bmp, etc.) that you
can use or you can use the TEMPLATE.BMP file to create your own
banner (using this file will give you the correct color palette).
To create your own banner, load the TEMPLATE.BMP file into your
favorite paint program and edit away. All banners must be 12
pixels wide by 8 pixels high and save in a BMP format or else
they will not work.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Join Squad</strong>- This
menu option (active only when connected to a Zone) brings up a
dialogue box asking for <em><strong>Squad Name</strong></em> and <em><strong>Password</strong></em>.
You can join an existing Squad if you know the password or you
can start your own Squad (as long the name has not been taken
yet) by entering a Name and Password just like you did when
creating your pilot name.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Dissolve Squad</strong>-
This menu option (active only when connected to a Zone) will
dissolve the squad you are currently a member of <strong>ONLY</strong>
if the squad was created by the account that you are currently
logged on with.</font></p>
