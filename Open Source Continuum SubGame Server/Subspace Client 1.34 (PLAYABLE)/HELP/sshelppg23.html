principle elements of closing.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial">The Spider</font>
<font face="Arial"> is of average speed, average
handling and weakly armed. Its one great advantage is that of
cloaking. The cloak device, when turned on, makes the Spider
invisible to the naked eye, giving it a huge advantage in terms
of intelligence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Spider&#146;s best form of attack is to
zoom in from the side of the targets vector, deliver a volley of
rounds, then egress to the rear of the enemy and disappear again.
The rearward egress forces an additional delay on the enemy that
he has to reverse his vector to follow you costing him precious
moments that allow you to change direction again and give him the
slip. Once at a safe distance, the Spider can turn off the
stealth, recharge his batteries and repeat the process until a
kill is achieved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Spider requires great self restraint
however as you must always hold in reserve enough energy to
remain in stealth until you are a safe distance away. A
disciplined Spider pilot will wait until he sees the enemy
visually then pound him with 5 rounds before disappearing away
again into the black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One particularly sneaky tactic a Spider
pilot can use is to hover around a powerup while cloaked (without
actually picking it up) and when an enemy approaches the powerup,
the spider pilot can fire a volley of bullets at the unsuspecting
pilot, potentially killing the player before he even realizes he
is being shot at.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A Spider with Stealth and the Cloaking
device, which makes the ship invisible to the eye and on radar,
is one of the most potent weapons in the game. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The nemesis of the stealth is the X-RADAR
which reveals all stealthed and cloaked ships on radar. However
X-RADAR costs energy to maintain and you should not assume that
even if a ship has already demonstrated XRADAR that it is always
on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To fight and win with the Spider takes
cunning and skill but there is great satisfaction destroying an
enemy without him ever knowing of your existence until its too
late.</font></p>
