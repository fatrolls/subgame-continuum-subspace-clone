Rincewind&#146;s strategy guide is full of extremely useful
information and version 3.11 is included with the retail box. The
latest version can be found at an &quot;Unofficial SubSpace
Website&quot; at <b>http://subspace.warzone.com</b>. Although
this document was initially written &quot;UNOFFICIALLY&quot;, it
was highly recommended by the SubSpace Team and why it is
included in the retail version.</font></p>
