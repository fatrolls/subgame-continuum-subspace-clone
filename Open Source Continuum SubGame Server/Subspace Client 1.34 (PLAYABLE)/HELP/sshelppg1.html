<p><font face="Arial">HANDLING THE SHIPS</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">Although the ships in SUBSPACE are
    often upgraded and downgraded much of the time, a player will
    very often be flying the basic ship with its individual
    characteristics. Scanning through the text may also give you
    new ideas on how to use the different upgrades. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The key to success in SUBSPACE is
    learning how to handle your ship. Many a pilot has escaped
    death by knowing just when to turn to avoid enemy fire.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">GAME SECTORS</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">Each game SECTOR is listed when you
    boot up. A SECTOR is a game type like WARZONE. Within each
    SECTOR are many ARENAS, typically 20-80 players each. After
    you enter an ARENA you can cycle to other PUBLIC ARENAS by
    going to a safe zone or spectator mode and hitting
    SHIFT+INSERT. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">PRIVATE ARENAS</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">In addition to cycling through the
    public arenas within each Zone players can create their own
    PRIVATE ARENA by using the following command. ?GO NAME. This
    is useful for players who want a private battle or want to
    duel it out. You can exit a private arena by creating another
    private arena or by using SHIFT+INSERT (go to a safety zone
    to keep powerups) to cycle though Public Arenas</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">THOR&#146;S HAMMER</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">This artifact is an incredibly powerful
    weapon and its mighty warhead is the largest in the game.
    Unfortunately, due to the warhead&#146;s size there is no
    generator powerful enough to fire it so it requires its own
    built in generator. This generator warps space/time so much
    it gives THOR&#146;S HAMMER the ability to pass through
    inanimate objects. However a ship can only carry a limited
    number of these weapons and the generator is SO unstable that
    users may find THOR&#146;S HAMMER will destroy the user as
    much as the target. Handle with care.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Tip:</b> THOR&#146;S HAMMER is great
    to &quot;Winkle&quot; out an enemy ship hiding in a
    structure. It passes straight through walls and can often be
    the &quot;Final Blow&quot;.</font></p>
