1.	GRANT OF LIMITED LICENSE. Virgin Interactive 
Entertainment, Inc. hereby grants you (either an individual 
or an entity), the end user, the limited, non-transferable 
right to use this one copy of this software/cartridge 
product, and any accompanying electronic files and 
printed materials (collectively the "Product"), on any single 
computer or game platform only for your personal use and 
enjoyment. This License is your proof of license to 
exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained 
by you.  Virgin may terminate this License if you fail to 
comply with any of the terms contained herein.

2.	COPYRIGHT AND RESTRICTIONS. You have no 
ownership rights to the Product.  The Product is owned by 
Virgin and/or its suppliers and is protected by the United 
States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  
Virgin retains all rights not expressly granted herein.  You 
must therefore treat the Product like any other copyrighted 
material (e.g. a book or musical recording).

The Product is licensed to you only for your personal use 
and enjoyment and may not be used for any commercial 
purpose whatsoever.  You may not loan, rent, lease, give, 
sell, offer for sale, sublicense or otherwise transfer the 
Product, or any portion of the Product or anything 
incorporated therein, including any screen display, sound 
or accompanying documentation, to any third party, nor 
may you permit any other person to use the Product in 
exchange for remuneration.  Further, you may not place 
the Product on any computer, communications, or other 
system or network that would allow multiple users to 
access it, except with respect to game servers as 
permitted in Section 4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 
one case you may transfer your rights under this License 
on a permanent basis provided you transfer this License 
and the Product, including all accompanying printed 
materials, while retaining no copies, and the recipient 
agrees to the terms of this License.  If the Product is an 
update, any transfer must include this update and all prior 
revisions.

You also may not copy, modify, adapt, translate, create 
derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, 
distribute, transmit, decompile, disassemble or otherwise 
reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer or derive 
source code from, all or any portion of the Product or 
anything incorporated therein, including any screen 
display, sound or accompanying documentation, or permit 
or encourage any third party to do so.  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, if the Product contains personal computer 
software, you may either (a) make one copy of the 
software solely for backup or archival purposes, or (b) 
transfer the software to a single hard disk provided you 
keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.  
Further, if the Product contains a map or level editor, you 
may use the editor in accordance with the instructions in 
the accompanying documentation to create maps or levels 
for your personal use and enjoyment, and you may allow 
others to use such maps or levels for their personal use 
and enjoyment, but in no event may such maps or levels 
be exploited commercially in any manner, by you or any 
other person or entity.  

3.	COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION PROHIBITED.  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing restrictions, 
specifically you may not offer the Product on a pay-per-
play basis or on a computer system or network to which 
you lease or rent access to others, electronically distribute 
the Product, or any portion of the Product or anything 
incorporated therein, including any screen display, sound 
or accompanying documentation, or, if the Product 
contains a map or level editor, sell or permit any third 
party to sell maps or levels you create for use with the 
Product.  Commercial exploitation licenses are available in 
certain circumstances by contacting Virgin as set forth at 
the end of this License

4.	GAME SERVERS.  The only authorized method of 
accessing any server to use the Product is by using an 
unmodified copy of the Product as distributed by or for 
Virgin.  You shall select and then use any such server all 
at your sole cost, expense and risk, including any 
communication costs, such as telephone charges and/or 
Internet access fees. 

You may establish a server for purposes of facilitating 
game play only if no remuneration is exchanged in 
connection with your server.  If you elect to establish a 
server for purposes of facilitating game play, you shall do 
so all at your sole cost, expense and risk.  Without limiting 
any other provision of this License, you may not modify 
the server software or use the server software except for 
its intended use as set forth in the documentation and in 
accordance with the terms of this License.

Virgin shall have no responsibility or liability to you or any 
other person or entity for establishing or selecting a 
server, any technical, service or other problems or 
difficulties that you may experience in connection with 
connecting to, using or maintaining a server, any player’s 
or server operator's compliance with any rules or 
procedures set forth in this License, the acts or omissions 
of any player or server operator or any cost or expense 
incurred by you in connection with the selection, use, 
establishment or maintenance of a server, or otherwise in 
connection with any server.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the 
Product is an Internet only game, the Product is 
dependent on the availability of servers to connect your 
game with other game players. Although at the time of the 
initial commercial release of this Product, Virgin will 
maintain servers with which you can connect to play the 
game, Virgin does not guarantee that it will continue to 
maintain those servers or that servers established by 
others will be adequate for your use or maintained for any 
period of time.

5.	 APPROPRIATE GAME PLAY; RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR GAME PLAY.  You agree to not take any action or 
pass any communication, either in or through the Product, 
that interferes with another player’s ability to enjoy his or 
her play of the game or which is objectionable or 
inappropriate.  Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, examples of unacceptable behavior include 
harassing, threatening, embarrassing or intimidating 
another player or person or entity, transmitting any 
unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, profane, 
offensive, obscene, harassing, defamatory, vulgar or 
hateful communication or material, or any racially, 
ethnically or otherwise objectionable communication or 
material; impersonating another person or entity, 
including, without limitation, a Virgin employee or 
representative, an employee or representative of the 
operator of the server, another player or an information 
provider; disparaging the Product, Virgin or its 
representatives or employees, the server operator or its 
representatives or employees, any other player or any 
other person or entity; and, intentionally or unintentionally 
violating any applicable local, state, national or 
international law, regulation or treaty. You are completely 
and solely liable for all communications and other 
activities of every kind and nature conducted by or 
through your screen name/log-in name.

6.	LOSS OF PRIVILEGES.  In the event that you 
engage in conduct prohibited by this License, or otherwise 
commit any other breach of this License, then one or 
more of the following may occur: you may be issued a 
warning; your account’s chat or other communication abilities 
may be turned off; use of your account may be temporarily or 
permanently blocked; and your use of any other on-line 
gaming or other similar account that you then or may in the 
future maintain with the operator of the server or Virgin or 
their respective affiliates may be temporarily or permanently 
blocked.

7.	NO MONITORING OR PRIVACY.  
Communications in connection with the Product are not 
private and often occur in real-time.  Although the rules 
regarding appropriate game play are set forth in this 
License, no person or entity will, as a matter of policy, 
screen, edit, monitor or police the content of the 
communications or other materials transmitted by players, 
and therefore there is no promise or guarantee that other 
players will not provide content or access to content that 
players or their parents may find objectionable or 
inappropriate.  Notwithstanding the lack of any policy of 
screening, editing, monitoring or policing the content of 
the materials or communications transmitted by players, 
you acknowledge and agree that, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, the operator of the server may, in its 
sole discretion, monitor some, all or none of the "chat" and 
other areas of the game for adherence to this License, 
choose to act upon inappropriate use of  "chat" features or 
game play, collect, disclose, distribute, compile and 
otherwise use for its purposes, as it deems appropriate, 
any and all data and information gathered from use of the 
Product and its "chat" features.

with the accompanying written materials for a period of 
ninety (90) days from the date of the Product's initial 
purchase.  Any implied warranties on the Product are 
limited to ninety (90) days.  SOME 
STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW

11.	CUSTOMER REMEDIES.  Virgin's entire liability 
and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Virgin's option, 
either return of the price paid for the Product or repair or 
replacement of the Product that does not meet the Limited 
Warranty set forth in Section 4, and that is returned to 
Virgin with a copy of your receipt.  In no event shall 
Virgin's liability with respect to this limited warranty exceed 
the cost of replacement of the media on which the 
Product is recorded.  The Limited Warranty set forth in 
Section 4 is void if failure of the Product has resulted from 
accident, abuse, misapplication or any wrongful act by 
you.  Any replacement of the Product will be warranted for 
the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) 
days, whichever is longer.  Neither these remedies nor 
any product support services offered by Virgin are 
available for this U.S.A. version Product outside of the

12.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL 
VIRGIN OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, 
DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, 
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS 
INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PRODUCT, EVEN IF VIRGIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  BECAUSE 
SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, 
THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN 
NO EVENT SHALL VIRGIN'S LIABILITY BY OPERATION 
OF LAW, IF ANY, BE GREATER THAN THE PRICE YOU 
PAID FOR THE PRODUCT.  THE WARRANTY AND 
REMEDIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE EXCLUSIVE AND 
IN LIEU OF ALL OTHERS, ORAL OR WRITTEN, 
STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  NO DEALER, 
DISTRIBUTOR, AGENT OR EMPLOYEE IS
