<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SubSpace /OS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Introduction.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SubSpace /OS is an in game
programming system that allows you to create and maintain your
own SubSpace games (or Zones as they are called) on a remote
server.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SubSpace is configurable in just
about every regard. This amount of configurability means that
making a SubSpace Zone can be a complex process. Fear not ,most
zones that you will want to make can easily be made using an
existing template with minor changes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Creating a Zone can be a thankless
task. You spend hours making maps/artwork and configuring your
zone and then everyone hates it - or even worse nobody comes at
all. On the flip side it is an amazing feeling to design a game
and have others enjoy themselves in it. Either way the prime
motivation for you making a zone should be - yourself. If you
like it then the chances are someone else will.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to the world of
SubSpace/OS Game design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Basic Design Philosophy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rule number one of multiplayer
game design is - do not design the game, that&#146;s the players
job. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a single player game you can
design a story and script out what the player is going to do.
Most single player games are puzzle games of some sort, from the
latest 3d shooter to realtime wargames the formula is the same -
Do X action to get to the reward Y, repeat until CD space runs
out. The reward is usually in the form of some animated sequence
or a new weapon or level, however the game is always scripted to
the game designers vision. This is very good for single player
games but when applied to a multiplayer environment it is
disastrous. This is because multiplayer games do not end, they
are infinitely replayable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A single player game designer is
like a sculptor whose vision we get to enjoy. A multiplayer game
designer is more like an architect who although he designs the
building cannot control what goes on within it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The truth is that when dealing
with real people THE SIMPLER THE BETTER. Do not over complicate
the player with unnecessary details or constrict his activities
EVEN when it is good for him. We are all familiar with this
phenomenon in real life. How many times have you been irritated
with a car door that autolocks every time you close it forcing
you to unlock every time? Or even worse how many times have you
bought software that tries to force you to register automatically
and you have to figure out a way of stopping it?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With this in mind all the
information needed to play your zone should be brief and easy to
understand. Background stories and info are always entertaining
but should be presented AFTER the critical game information not
before. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Players may well enjoy a 4 page
&quot;novella&quot; about the war between the great zarsquids of
beta 3' and the terran imperium but in the end if it says -
&quot;The object is to kill all opposing players. Human ships on
freq zero move really fast. Zarsquids on freq one have
cloak.&quot; then you may want to consider putting that at the
start of the text not the end.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally unlike a single player
game don&#146;t try to tell the players to &quot;go this point,
do this, then go to this point.&quot; it ain&#146;t gonna happen.
People instinctively know how to play, they don&#146;t need to be
given too many rules. Put some humans in a room add a ball and
they will have fun.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Level design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Great architects are not the ones
who make the gaudy strange looking buildings, they are the ones
who make buildings that people feel comfortable inside.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You should take this to heart when
designing the SubSpace level map for your game. I have seen
dozens of maps get left empty simply because the designer
insisted on spelling his name in tile blocks or created pretty
pictures all over it. Conversely players flock to levels that are
functional and designed for their convenience instead of the
designers ego.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few practical tips.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Limit &quot;wormholes&quot; to
three or less if possible. Wormholes are huge burden on the
client and most players do not have a machine above a P90.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Do not make levels dense. Huge
strips of tiles may run fine on your machine but there is a
reason that most &quot;official&quot; SubSpace maps are very pipe
like. Slower machines simply cannot handle huge tile areas. Try
to keep all your walls to one tile thickness.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Don&#146;t draw &quot;radar
pictures&quot; in the tiles. Not only does it make you look lame
but it means you are designing for looks not gameplay.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Avoid &quot;choke points&quot; in
your level if you are allowing mines. Any area ten tiles or less
that is frequently traveled WILL be mined.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If your game allows safe zones put
lots of them around. Remember one safe zone means one place to
mine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">ZONE OR SCENARIO?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The difference between a zone and
a scenario is that a Scenario happens at set time and a Zone is
always running. This is because scenarios tend to be more complex
and involve more planning than a regular Zone game. I must
confess I love the thrill of a scenario when I know only have one
life and once I die - that&#146;s it. For others they find the
work and planning of a scenario too tedious when all they want to
do is get in and have a blast. Designing your game to be played
once or once a week can be beneficial as it does focus a large
group together at once on the flip side if you are organizing
this sort of event you should assume at least 20% non
-attendance. Don&#146;t take it personal organizing a meeting
with people from all over the world at a particular time is a
very difficult thing, just plan for the 20% not to turn up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU FAIL.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You will fail - we all do. You
have spent two weeks working on a great zone with art &amp; sound
pack and nobody is playing it. Your friends in the game always
claim they have to go to &quot;dinner&quot; when you mention
playing in your zone - what did you do wrong?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Firstly did you post your zone on
the SubSpace message boards? (http://SubSpace.vie.com)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Did you contact the numerous
SubSpace guilds and organizations that love to promote new
events?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Are your instructions simple?
Remember when most people enter a game they WILL NOT read
instructions no matter how much you insist that it is vital. So
they will ask other players, if it can be answered in a sentence
then they will get an answer otherwise they will be ignored and
will leave.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Are you annoying? This is the
toughest but sometimes you can put so much work into something
you become a bit of a pain about it. Constantly emailing your
(soon to be ex-) friends to come and play in it or spamming other
zones with ads for yours. Nobody likes someone who is pushy, have
some good manners and if you catch your friends playing in
another zone don&#146;t try to make them feel guilty. You wont
make them feel guilty (mothers do it much better than you ever
can) but you will make them want to avoid you or play under
alias.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Is your game unplayable? Is your
zone like this? &quot;Bullets fire twice as fast! All ships fly
faster than the jav! fire 8 level 4 bombs at once with 64
shrapnel! 6000 energy!&quot; If so - your zone sucks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Super Zones&quot; are the
typical rookie zone that vets avoid like the plague. The thinking
tends to be that &quot;16 shrapnel is fun so 32 will be double as
much fun!&quot; it isn&#146;t. Game restraint and balance is a
very delicate process and a well balanced ship mixture is tough
to get right. When in doubt DOWNGRADE don&#146;t upgrade, you
will always be better off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For every ship positive give a
negative. for Example in my revised ships I gave the warbird the
ability to use stealth for nearly zero energy because it was so
small. Conversely I reduced its energy max to 1200 because it was
so small. Always balance. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You may have a great connection
but to most players fast firing bullets , zippy ships and lots of
weapons mean one thing - LAG. Regular modem users will look at
any &quot;super&quot; zone and leave immediately. You should only
EXTREMELY RARELY increase ship stats over the default maximums,
we spent over a year and a half getting them to play well over a
modem so tread carefully, you have been warned.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">GAME BALANCE</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A player enters your game for the
first time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">BAM he gets killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newbie gets restarted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He sees another enemy and tries to
get away, no good thee enemy is much faster than him....</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">BAM he gets killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newbie gets restarted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newbie tried to &quot;green&quot;
up however more powered up ships are doing the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">BAM he gets killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newbie leaves game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I had no fun at all in that zone,
yes I was that newbie. The mistake? We had the max energy set to
3000. This is a real example from a test zone we ran a year ago,
we found it was next to impossible for zero bounty ship to green
up fast enough to survive in a zone where 3000 energy ships where
flying. The week after we reduced max energy to 1700. We never
realized that one stat could unbalance the game so much, but it
did.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Always think of the poor newbie
when you design your game. A good rule of thumb should be that
even the best game player in the universe should be dying at
least once an hour with most good players dying once every five
minutes. If you find expert players surviving for as long as they
want in your game then you have a problem of game balance. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a good test you should let a
friend of yours get a full powered ship then you fight him with
zero power ups. If you don&#146;t beat him one time out of five
then your zone is unbalanced. This is fine if the aim of the zone
is not combat (flag grabbing for example) but if it&#146;s purely
combat then you should make changes. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unbalancing stats: Some stats
really unbalance the game if they are set to high with a slow
greening process then they make the game unplayable for the
newbie.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Max energy: The newbies level one
guns are simply incapable of doing enough damage to the fully
powered enemy. Think long and hard before raising this stat.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Max Charge rate: Sure it feels
great to be able to blaze away constantly with bullets but if you
cant kill anyone then it reduces the point somewhat. Throw in
extra &quot;super&quot; prizes instead of raising this stat.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Max Thrust &amp; Rotate: The
Warbird default really is about the max maneuverability you
should give any ship. Given latency issues any more than that and
your zone will become know as &quot;lag city&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Max Speed: A tricky one to judge
but its no fun to never be able to run down a super fast ship,
particularly in flag games.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Things to help balance your game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are several things that are
useful to balancing your game and keeping the expert players from
ruining your zone. These elements are easy to spot because the
expert pilots will complain about them being unfair. Pay close
attention these complaints from expert pilots as they are very
useful tools in your design arsenal. Usually experts complain
when they die &quot;unfairly&quot; this can be good and bad. If
someone YOU KNOW is an expert is making these comments then you
have a GREAT mine of information. Remember this ONLY applies to
pilots who you KNOW are experts, not just whiners.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here are some common examples.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Damn shrapnel&quot; - Great,
this is as it should be. Players should die if they get to near
combat. Complaints about this are a good thing as experts will
always complain about something and this is the least important
it shows your game is well balanced.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Damn bursters&quot; - Check
the complainers win/loss ratio. If its 1/1 or worse then he may
be right (most experts run around 2/1 or better) and you may want
to reduce the burst damage or frequency.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Damn Neg Terriers ( or
insert ship name)&quot; - Probably not an expert. Most good
pilots can out maneuver any neg ship, but if valid he is probably
complaining that he has to kill lower powered ships to get to the
powerful ones. This can be a problem which is easily addressed by
reducing the starting ships offensive capability slightly (even a
minor rotation rate reduction is devastating to a beginning
ship). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Damn Lag&quot; - This is the
most worrying because it almost certainly ISNT lag he is
complaining about. Experts have a good &quot;feel&quot; for how
many bullets it takes to down a ship. If you have tinkered with
the stats too much then he may be blaming lag. Look at the stats
again and reduce some of the weirder ones back towards the
defaults. If it is lag then you are probably overloading modems
due to the &quot;super ship&quot; syndrome. Tone down the stats
put less bullets &amp; bombs on screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">SETTING UP YOUR OWN SERVER</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To set up your own server you will
need the following&#133;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A nice fast PC (p133 and above
with 32 meg RAM is probably the minimum)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A nice internet connection. If you
are going to host a server we highly recommend you have at least
a ISDN line. Slower than this will simply be an unpleasant
experience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A static IP is reccomended if you
intend to make your server popular.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To set up the server simply create
a directory EG:&quot;serversample&quot; and put the following
files in it.</font></p>

the &quot;BOMB&quot; area. The second gives a description of the

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">How do you read entries?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A typical entry looks something
like this&#133;&#133;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PrizeWeight:QuickCharge:0:0:255:Likelyhood
of 'Full Energy' prize appearing</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PrizeWeight:Energy:0:0:255:Likelyhood

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PrizeWeight:Rotation:0:0:255:Likelyhood

of 'Cloak' prize appearing</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PrizeWeight:AntiWarp:0:0:255:Likelyhood
of 'AntiWarp' prize appearing</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lets run down the columns&#133;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First off all look to the far
right of the first column. This gives you a rough idea of what
the entry is about, in this case it says..</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Likelyhood of 'Full Energy'
prize appearing&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This means that the line sets a
number that determines how likely it is that the prize a player
picks up is a FULL ENERGY prize. This does NOT govern how many
prizes appear (that&#146;s another parameter) merely what KIND of
prize it will be.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next there are three numbers that
in this case are..</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;0:0:255:&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first number is what you have
the parameter set to. The second is the minimum possible to set
it to. The Third number is the maximum possible to set it to. As
it is set to zero that prize will never appear. However if you
set it above zero then the probability is based on a comparison
of how likely compared to other prizes you want it to be. For
example if you set all your prizes to a number between 1 and 100
then the prize set to 100 would appear most frequently but a
prize set to 1 would appear around 1 in 100 times. It IS possible
to have numbers the same for prizes of equal value.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">NOTE: In OUR examples below there
are only two numbers eg:0:255 these are the maximum and minimum.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next is only piece of text that
gives a short text note to what the parameter is about. In this
case.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Quickcharge&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally the category of prize is

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;PrizeWeight&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only thing you need to worry
about is the first number. You CANNOT change the minimum or
maximum (the second &amp; third numbers) they are there for your
reference only.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PARAMETERS</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I will go through all of the
parameters as if I was making a zone to give you an idea of the
creation process. The prefered method is to change these
parameters WITHIN the game by using the ESC C command. This gives
you a reminder of which parameter does what and a breif
explantation.</font></p>

does at &quot;ground zero&quot;. All bombs actually do the same

<p><font face="Arial"><i>+Bomb:BombAliveTime:100:12000:Time bomb

<p><font face="Arial">Bombs have a built in &quot;expiration
date&quot; that is measured in milliseconds. Thus if you fire any
bomb it will disappear after this time. We do not allow bombs to
go on forever until they hit the edge of the map because of the
addition traffic that this would cause with an arena of many
players, however you may want to up this time limit for smaller
player games.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><i>+Bomb:BombExplodeDelay:0:250:How long

triggering it)</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bombs in SubSpace are actually semi-smart
this delay is the amount of time (in ms) the bomb will wait for
the target to move closer before exploding. Bombs will
automatically detonate if the closest enemy ship to it starts to
move away thus ensuring the most amount of damage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><i>+Bomb:BombExplodePixels:1:250:Blast

from then on it is multiplied by the bomb level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><i>+Bomb:ProximityDistance:0:10:Radius of

an &quot;InitialRotation&quot; for the warbird, jav etc all of
which are independent. We highly recommend taking the existing
ship models and tweaking them slowly rather than designing a new
ship from scratch. This six ship types in the game have been
worked out over 2 years and its very easy to unbalance ship
