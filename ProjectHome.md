This is a SubGame clone decompiled from the original subgame.exe from the cdrom released by virgin interactive back in 1997.

It supports Subspace 1.31 ~ 1.34

I have added support for Continuum v0.40 as well.

It's extremely buggy it barely works but it's a good project for someone who wants to do something. If you make any good changes on it post on http://forums.minegoboom.com/ with your updates.
